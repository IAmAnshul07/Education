            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily provided by public schools (controlled
                and funded by the government at three levels: central, state and local) and private schools. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental
                right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is
                7:5.As per the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2012, 96.5% of all rural children between the
                ages of 6-14 were enrolled in school. This is the fourth annual survey to report enrollment above 96%.
                India has maintained an average enrolment ratio of 95% for students in this age group from year 2007 to
                2014.</p>

                enrolled in school has come down to 2.8% in the year academic year 2018 (ASER 2018).[11] Another report
                from 2013 stated that there were 229 million students enrolled in different accredited urban and rural

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">State Government Boards of Education: Most of the state governments have
                at least one "State board of secondary school education". However, some states like Andhra Pradesh have
                more than one. Also the union territories do not have a board. Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman
                and Diu, and Lakshadweep and Puducherry Lakshadweep share the services with a larger state. The boards
                set curriculum from Grades 1 to 12 and the curriculum varies from state to state and has more local
                appeal with examinations conducted in regional languages in addition to English - often considered less
                rigorous than central curriculums such as CBSE or ICSE/ISC. Most of these conduct exams at 10th and 12th
                level, but some even at the 5th, 6th and 8th level.</p>
